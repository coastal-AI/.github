# **coastal-AI**

## About Us  
**coastal-AI** is a collaborative initiative between the **Artificial Intelligence Center (AIC) of the University of Oviedo** and the **Seagrass Ecology Group of the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO-CSIC)**. This joint venture leverages artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to address pressing ecological challenges in coastal environments.

## Mission  
Our mission is to innovate at the intersection of artificial intelligence and marine ecology, developing advanced tools and methods for the sustainable monitoring, analysis, and conservation of coastal ecosystems.

## Key Focus Areas  
1. **Coastal Habitat Mapping**  
   - AI-based semantic segmentation of drone and satellite imagery to map the distribution of seagrass meadows and macroalgal forests.  
   - Development of high-resolution maps to assist conservation planning.

2. **Monitoring Ecosystem Health**  
   - Machine learning models for tracking changes in seagrass cover and density.  
   - Automated detection of anthropogenic impacts such as pollution or habitat loss.  

3. **Data Integration and Accessibility**  
   - Creation of open-access datasets and tools for coastal researchers.  
   - Alignment with international standards like Darwin Core and INSPIRE for data sharing.
